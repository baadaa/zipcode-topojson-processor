# US Zip Processor

Built for a specific filtering/organizing need for a group of US zip codes, which can be expanded or/and repurposed.

- Review and adjust options in the `cities` object in `zip-processor.js` for your needs.
- Original `topojson` is taken from [jefffriesen's Gist here](https://gist.github.com/jefffriesen/6892860)
